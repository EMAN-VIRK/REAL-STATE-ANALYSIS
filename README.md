# REAL-STATE-ANALYSIS
A data-driven real estate market analysis of Pakistan using Zameen.com
 This report presents a data-driven analysis of over 18,000 residential real estate listings from Zameen.com across 25+
 Pakistani cities. The goal is to uncover trends in property pricing, rental yield (ROI), demand patterns, and investment
 opportunities.
 Key findings show that urban centers like Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore dominate in terms of luxury listings and
 premium rents. Smaller cities like Sargodha and Abbottabad, however, offer the highest rental yields, signaling excellent
 ROI potential.
 The report identifies affordability gaps, the rise of flats in urban cores, and the dominance of houses in the national
 property landscape.
